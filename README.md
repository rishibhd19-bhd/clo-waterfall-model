# CLO Waterfall Model

## What This Model Does

This Python model simulates the cashflow waterfall of a **Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)** — a structured finance vehicle that pools leveraged loans and issues multiple rated tranches to investors.

The model covers:

- **Capital structure setup** — Class A (AAA) through Class E (BB) notes + Equity tranche
- **Interest waterfall** — sequential payment from senior to junior, with fees deducted first
- **Principal waterfall** — sequential amortisation based on scheduled repayments and recoveries
- **OC (Overcollateralization) tests** — Pool Balance / Notes Balance must exceed trigger; breach diverts cash to deleverage senior tranche
- **IC (Interest Coverage) tests** — Collateral interest income / Note interest expense must exceed trigger; breach redirects cashflow
- **Default and recovery simulation** — Constant Default Rate (CDR) applied annually with haircut on recovery proceeds
- **Three scenario analysis** — Base Case, Stress, Severe Stress (GFC-style)
- **Equity IRR calculation** — residual distributions to equity investors
- **Charts** — waterfall breakdown, OC test ratios, cumulative losses, equity distributions

## Capital Structure

| Tranche  | Rating | Size ($M) | Spread (bps) | OC Trigger | IC Trigger |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Class A  | AAA    | 248.0     | +145         | 123.5%     | 120.0%     |
| Class B  | AA     |  32.0     | +185         | 117.5%     | 115.0%     |
| Class C  | A      |  20.0     | +240         | 112.5%     | 110.0%     |
| Class D  | BBB    |  16.0     | +330         | 108.5%     | 106.0%     |
| Class E  | BB     |  12.0     | +550         | 104.5%     | 103.0%     |
| Equity   | NR     |  12.0     | Residual     | —          | —          |
| **Total Pool** | | **400.0** | | | |

Initial Overcollateralization = **122.0%**  
SOFR assumption = **5.30%** | Weighted Average Spread = **3.85%**

## Scenario Assumptions

| Scenario      | CDR (Peak) | Recovery Rate | Equity IRR |
|---------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Base Case     | 2.5%       | 65%           | ~13%       |
| Stress        | 6.0%       | 55%           | ~11%       |
| Severe Stress | 9.0%       | 40%           | ~8%        |

## Key CLO Concepts Explained

**OC Test (Overcollateralization):**  
Pool balance divided by the outstanding balance of all notes at or senior to the tested tranche. If this falls below the trigger (e.g. 123.5% for Class A), available interest is redirected to pay down the most senior outstanding note instead of flowing to junior tranches.

**IC Test (Interest Coverage):**  
Collateral interest income divided by total interest due on notes at or senior to the tested tranche. A breach signals that the pool is not generating enough income to service senior obligations — cash is again diverted to deleverage.

**Waterfall priority:**  
Senior fees → Class A interest → [OC/IC test] → Class B interest → [OC/IC test] → ... → Class E interest → Sub fees → Equity residual

**CDR (Constant Default Rate):**  
Annual percentage of the loan pool assumed to default. Recovery rate determines what fraction of defaulted principal is recovered. Net loss = defaults × (1 − recovery rate).

**SOFR:**  
Secured Overnight Financing Rate — replaced LIBOR as the floating rate benchmark for leveraged loans and CLO notes.

## Real-World Context

This model reflects structures I worked with directly at:
- **BNY Mellon Corporate Trust** (June 2024 – June 2025) — CLO/CDO administration, Solvas platform, ATE mapping, OC/IC test monitoring
- **Apex Fund Services** (September 2025 – Present) — Syndicated loan operations, trade processing, portfolio setup, fund administration
